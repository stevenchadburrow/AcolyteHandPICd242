# AcolyteHandPICd242

This is the Acolyte Hand PIC'd 242, containing two PIC24 microcontrollers:  
The PIC24EP512GP202 and the PIC24FJ128GB202.  
The 'EP does all of the graphics, sound, and button inputs.  
The 'FJ is exclusively designed to be used as a USB host for HID and MSD.

The board is an all through-hole design for easy soldering.

Much of the code will be reused from the Acolyte Hand PIC'd 24 project.
